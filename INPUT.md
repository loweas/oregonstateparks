		    \begin{abstract}
    The role of social media and the effect on consumer behavior is an emerging field of study. Apps, such as Instagram, expose individuals to new areas with ease,  providing location data via hashtags, geolocation markers and visual indicators. The information is instantaneous and can provide current climate, air and park quality, along with many different photos capturing the natural beauty. The rise in visitation in parks in the United States coincides with the proliferation of social media. I intend to examine if social media content can explain the shift in demand.

\section{Introduction}
\setlength{\parindent}{1cm} \indent
	\par  Recreation comprises a significant share of the U.S. economy with an estimated annual value of \$373.7 billion, or nearly 2.0 percent of GDP \cite{Bureau2018}.Visitation to national parks in the United States have been relatively steady between the late 1990s to early 2000s \cite{Stevens2014} . Starting in 2014, these parks experienced consecutive years of record breaking visitation with an average increase of about 10\% each year. An increase in visitation to our public lands produces a dynamic tension for state and federal agencies responsible for both managing recreation and preserving wild places. With no end in sight, public land mangers are discussing many policy changes to address the toll of overcrowding. Managers in Zion National Park are considering requiring reservations for entry, the first of its kind for the National Park Service (NPS) \cite{Turkewitz2017}.
	\par On a state level, Oregon State Parks are experiencing similar challenges due to a recent shift in demand. Figure 1 compares the visitation numbers of Oregon state parks (scale 35million visitors) and the National Parks (scale 250million). For Oregon, the increase began two years earlier. The cause of the lag coincides with the government shut down of 2013, where visitors were restricted entry to any National Park for 17 days. The event occurred suddenly and the end was uncertain, affecting many travel plans for visitors.
